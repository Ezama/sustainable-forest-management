Sustainable forest management (SFM) is an approach to managing forests in a way that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It involves the integration of environmental, social, and economic considerations to ensure that forests are utilized in a responsible and balanced manner. The goal of sustainable forest management is to maintain and enhance the overall health, biodiversity, productivity, and resilience of forests while providing a range of goods and services.
